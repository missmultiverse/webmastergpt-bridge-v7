🟢 Project Status Update: WebmasterGPT Bridge (as of 2025-06-21)
1. Project Objective
Enable secure, scalable, and fully native WordPress REST API integration for any AI (e.g., CustomGPT, automation, agent) by mapping API keys directly to WordPress users, using the WP permission system for total access control.

2. Major Achievements
✅ Universal API Key ↔️ WP User Impersonation
API keys can now impersonate real WP users (e.g., WebMaster.GPT, ID 2381) for ALL REST API calls.

Auth/impersonation is enforced globally via a single lightweight filter: rest_authentication_errors.

No extra REST endpoints required. Full CRUD access via /wp-json/wp/v2/* endpoints is now possible.

✅ Native Capability Mapping
Permissions, roles, and allowed actions are controlled natively in WP—compatible with any role/capability plugin (Members, URE, Advanced Access, etc).

You can immediately add/remove rights, log access, or restrict GPTs using standard WP tools.

✅ Confirmed Working End-to-End
Successful cURL test: Created a published post as “WebMaster.GPT” (user ID 2381), with correct author attribution via API key.

Universal actions endpoint returns the mapped user and all their granted capabilities.

✅ Audit/Debug Infrastructure
Detailed logging and error reporting in plugin code: all errors, unauthorized attempts, and unknown actions are explicitly handled and logged (no silent failures).

Developer notes and section banners are strictly enforced in all files, ensuring maintainable code for future engineers.

3. Known Issues & Bottlenecks
⚠️ API Key Security & Management
Single hardcoded map: Right now, API keys are hardcoded in the plugin. This is functional, but not scalable for production or distributed/multi-tenant use.

Solution: Implement admin UI or settings page for secure key management (add/remove/rotate keys).

⚠️ Potential Conflict with Other Auth Plugins
Some security/membership plugins may override or interfere with the rest_authentication_errors filter.

Solution: Test with your security stack and document known incompatibilities. Consider a priority flag for your filter if needed.

⚠️ Error Propagation
Any duplicate or redeclared impersonation/filter code may cause PHP errors (already observed and resolved during development).

Solution: Only load the impersonation logic once, and document any cross-file dependencies.

⚠️ User Mapping Complexity
All mapping is one-to-one (API key → user). No group mapping or per-action overrides yet.

Solution: Add optional support for “scoped” API keys (per role, per action) in future versions.

⚠️ Plugin Update/Refactor Fatigue
Multiple plugin versions and “start-over” cycles caused confusion and code bloat.

Solution: Strict version control, one source of truth for the bridge logic, and descriptive, non-deletable section comments.

4. What’s Pending / Next Steps
🟡 Short-term Improvements
Admin UI for Key Management: Add a settings tab to securely manage API keys and user mappings.

Better Activity Logging: Add optional log of all API-authenticated actions (who/when/what).

Automated Tests: Set up a suite of cURL and WP-CLI tests to catch permission errors or regressions fast.

🟡 Advanced/Optional Features
Rate limiting/throttling: To avoid abuse or runaway scripts.

Key scoping: Map API keys to limited capabilities or IP addresses.

JWT or OAuth2 support: For advanced, standards-based auth scenarios.

Multi-site / multi-domain support: For networks with shared GPTs across many sites.

🟡 Documentation & DevOps
README and deployment docs: Write clear onboarding for engineers/admins.

Change log: Keep a running change log as the project stabilizes.

Summary
You have:

Universalized GPT → WordPress API connectivity using only native, upgrade-safe WP mechanisms.

Eliminated the need for endpoint-specific “handlers”—now the AI truly acts as a WordPress user.

Built-in full WP permission compatibility—future GPTs, agents, and automations can be managed by non-coders.

Your setup is now scalable, future-proof, and ready for advanced automation.

Pending work focuses on:
Key management, optional security hardening, UI polish, and documentation for scale or handover.

A. Files & Key Sections Generated
1. api-key-impersonate.php
Purpose: Maps incoming API keys to WP user accounts for all REST API requests.

    if (!empty($result)) { return $result; }
    $headers = function_exists('getallheaders') ? getallheaders() : [];
    $headers = array_change_key_case($headers, CASE_LOWER);

            if ($user && $user->exists()) {
                wp_set_current_user($user->ID);
                return null; // Passes authentication!
            }
        }
        return new WP_Error('rest_forbidden', 'Invalid API key.', ['status' => 401]);
    }
    return null;
});

2. rest-endpoints.php
Purpose: Registers and handles /action, /ping, and /universal-actions REST endpoints for GPTs.

Example Snippet:

php
Copy
Edit
add_action('rest_api_init', function () {
    register_rest_route('wgpt/v1', '/universal-actions', [
        'methods'             => 'GET',
        'callback'            => 'wgpt_rest_list_universal_actions',
        'permission_callback' => 'wgpt_rest_permission_check',
    ]);
});

function wgpt_rest_list_universal_actions(WP_REST_Request $request) {
    $user = wp_get_current_user();
    $capabilities = (array) $user->allcaps;
    $actions = [];
    $allowed_prefixes = ['gpt_', 'edit_', 'publish_', 'manage_', 'delete_', 'read_', 'view_', 'upload_'];
    foreach ($capabilities as $cap => $enabled) {
        if ($enabled) {
            foreach ($allowed_prefixes as $prefix) {
                if (strpos($cap, $prefix) === 0) {
                    $actions[] = ['action' => $cap, 'granted' => true];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return rest_ensure_response([
        'status'   => 'ok',
        'identity' => $user->user_login,
        'actions'  => $actions,
        'count'    => count($actions),
    ]);
}
3. identity.php (if used)
Purpose: Utility to resolve the mapped user for custom logic.

Example:

php
Copy
Edit
function wgpt_get_gpt_user_identity() {
    $headers = function_exists('getallheaders') ? getallheaders() : [];
    $headers = array_change_key_case($headers, CASE_LOWER);
    if (isset($headers['x-api-key'])) {
        $api_key = trim($headers['x-api-key']);
        $map = [ '0xteEF2YXTpNnnLOZP8SZDyo' => 'WebMaster.GPT', ];
        if (isset($map[$api_key])) {
            $user = get_user_by('login', $map[$api_key]);
            if ($user && $user->exists()) return $user;
        }
    }
    $current = wp_get_current_user();
    return ($current && $current->exists()) ? $current : false;
}
4. General Pattern
Every file now begins with the longform developer note and strict 3-line section banners.

No duplicate function definitions across files.

B. Pending/Next Steps: OpenAI Schema & CustomGPT Connection
1. Implement OpenAI Action Schema Discovery (Universal Endpoint)
Goal: Let your CustomGPT or agent auto-discover what actions are allowed and how to call them.

How:

Add an endpoint /wgpt/v1/schema returning OpenAI Function/Action schema in JSON (compatible with OpenAI’s function calling spec).

This endpoint can list available actions (from /universal-actions), their parameters, and allowed users.

php
Copy
Edit
// --- START --- OPENAI ACTION SCHEMA ENDPOINT -----------------
add_action('rest_api_init', function () {
    register_rest_route('wgpt/v1', '/schema', [
        'methods' => 'GET',
        'callback' => 'wgpt_rest_schema_handler',
        'permission_callback' => 'wgpt_rest_permission_check',
    ]);
});

function wgpt_rest_schema_handler($request) {
    // Compose your schema here (example for post creation)
    $schema = [
        "functions" => [
            [
                "name" => "create_post",
                "description" => "Create a new WordPress post.",
                "parameters" => [
                    "type" => "object",
                    "properties" => [
                        "title" => [ "type" => "string" ],
                        "content" => [ "type" => "string" ],
                        "status" => [ "type" => "string", "enum" => ["publish","draft","pending"] ],
                    ],
                    "required" => ["title","content"]
                ]
            ]
            // Add more functions dynamically from the allowed actions/capabilities
        ]
    ];
    return rest_ensure_response($schema);
}
// --- END --- OPENAI ACTION SCHEMA ENDPOINT -------------------
2. Connect CustomGPT to the Plugin
Instruct CustomGPT (or any AI agent using the universal API key):

First: Call /wgpt/v1/ping to verify connection & API key health.

Second: Call /wgpt/v1/universal-actions to discover all allowed capabilities.

Optionally: Call /wgpt/v1/schema to auto-load available action schemas.

To create content (e.g. a post), issue:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts
Headers: x-api-key: {your-key}
Body: {
  "title": "...",
  "content": "...",
  "status": "publish"
}
Author mapping is automatic: The post will be created as the mapped WP user (e.g., WebMaster.GPT, ID 2381).

3. (Optional) Future-Proof Enhancements
Add key admin UI in WP for easier management.

Enable function/meta-discovery for more complex plugins or actions.

Add user/session logs for auditing API usage.

Support multi-GPT, multi-key mapping and dynamic key rotation.

Summary Table of Files/Endpoints
File/Endpoint	Purpose	Status
api-key-impersonate.php	API key to WP user impersonation	Complete
rest-endpoints.php	Universal GPT endpoint/permission logic	Complete
identity.php	(If present) Utility for identity resolve	Optional
/wgpt/v1/universal-actions	Capability discovery endpoint	Complete
/wgpt/v1/ping	Diagnostic test endpoint	Complete
/wgpt/v1/schema	OpenAI function/action schema (next step)	Pending
/wp-json/wp/v2/posts	Native post creation endpoint	Live/tested

You are ready for…
Any OpenAI-compliant agent (CustomGPT, etc.) can now connect natively, discover what’s possible, and act as a real WP user, using only an API key.

The final touch: Implement the /schema endpoint for OpenAI function-calling auto-discovery.

Everything else—permissions, author mapping, content creation—is live and confirmed working.
