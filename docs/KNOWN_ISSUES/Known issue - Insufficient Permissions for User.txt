Known Issues Report & Solution Summary:
Issue 1: Insufficient Permissions for WebMaster.GPT User
Symptoms: Actions like create_post, list_universal_actions, and edit_post were returning a 403 Forbidden error.

Cause: The WebMaster.GPT user did not have sufficient permissions for these actions. The user lacked the necessary capabilities for tasks such as post creation, listing actions, and editing posts.

Solution to Fix Permissions:
Mapping Capabilities:
The first step in resolving this issue was to correctly map the capabilities for actions like edit_post, create_post, and list_posts in the action handler.

Here's the mapping section to add in the handlers-editor-publisher.php file:

php
Copy
Edit
// Add actions and permissions for WebMaster.GPT (Editor/Publisher)
$action_cap_map = [
    'edit_post' => 'edit_posts',
    'delete_post' => 'delete_posts',
    'create_post' => 'create_posts',
    'list_posts' => 'list_posts',
    'upload_media' => 'upload_files',
    'edit_media' => 'edit_files',
    'delete_media' => 'delete_files',
    'edit_post_featured_image' => 'edit_posts', // Special capability for editing the featured image
];
This ensures that WebMaster.GPT is granted the appropriate permissions to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as to upload and edit media files.

Confirm User Role/Permissions:
In addition to the code changes, WebMaster.GPT needed to be granted the required capabilities within WordPress User Role Editor or a similar plugin. Specifically, ensure the following capabilities are enabled:

create_posts

edit_posts

delete_posts

upload_files

edit_files

Issue 2: Forbidden Actions (list_universal_actions)
Symptoms: The 403 Forbidden error was returned for list_universal_actions indicating that WebMaster.GPT lacked permission to list available actions.

Solution to Fix Action Listing:
Permissions Mapping: Add a capability like list_universal_actions to the capabilities map.
If additional capabilities are required, they can be added to the handlers-editor-publisher.php file to properly manage roles for higher-level actions:

php
Copy
Edit
$action_cap_map['list_universal_actions'] = 'manage_options';
Admin-Level Permissions:

Ensure WebMaster.GPT has admin-level permissions, or equivalent, for tasks that require listing and managing actions (e.g., managing options).

Testing & Validation:
After adjusting the capabilities and ensuring proper permissions:

Test the functionality again using curl or API calls to ensure that actions like create_post, list_posts, and upload_media work as expected.

Check the logs to confirm successful execution of these actions.

Next Steps for Future References:
User Role and Permissions: Always verify that the user (e.g., WebMaster.GPT) has the appropriate WordPress role and capabilities, especially when encountering 403 errors.

Correct Capability Mapping: Ensure that all required actions are properly mapped in the action_cap_map section to avoid restricted access.

Admin Permissions for Elevated Actions: For actions such as list_universal_actions and any high-level administrative tasks, make sure the user has access to manage_options or similar admin permissions.

This solution should resolve permission-related issues for the WebMaster.GPT user while handling the most commonly used actions effectively.
