✅ Universal Endpoint: Current Status Summary (June -19)
📍 Endpoint Base:
/wp-json/webmastergpt/v1/webmaster-action
Registered in: includes/rest-endpoints.php

✅ What’s Working Now
Feature	Status	Description
🔗 Endpoint Registration	✅ Done	The endpoint is registered and accepts POST requests.
🔐 API Key Security	✅ Enforced	Requires x-api-key header; uses gpt_api_permission_check() for auth.
🧠 Action Routing	✅ Working	Routes via $_POST['type'], dispatches logic using a switch/case.
⚙️ Action Handlers	✅ Partial	Actions like list_plugins, read_error_log, and get_pending_actions are implemented.
📄 OpenAPI Schema	✅ Basic	Documented via openapi-generator.php with schema generation for tools like Postman.
🛠️ Tool Tab UI	✅ Exists	Admin Tools tab reflects supported actions from this endpoint.
🧪 Testing	✅ Successful	You have tested actions via Postman and frontend bridges.

🔧 What’s Missing / To Do
Task	Priority	Notes
🪝 Hookable Dispatcher	🟡 Medium	Replace hardcoded switch() with do_action("webmastergpt_handle_{$type}") for plugin extensibility.
🔐 Per-Action Capabilities	🟡 Medium	Add specific current_user_can() or role checks per action type.
📊 Logging & Audit Trail	🟠 Planned	Add audit logging for all actions invoked via this endpoint.
🚫 Error Translation Layer	🟠 Planned	Unify API error responses: { success: false, message: ..., code: ... }.
🧾 Self-Documenting UI	🟢 Optional	Add admin-side docs pulled from OpenAPI or inline comments.
⏱️ Rate Limiting	🟢 Optional	Protect against spam/misuse — especially for AI-exposed endpoints.
📁 File Upload Support	🟡 Planned	Expand to accept and save files as part of edit_file, upload_asset actions.

🔚 Summary
The universal endpoint is fully functional and in production, but modularity, logging, and developer extensibility are the next major steps to complete the vision. It's stable enough for controlled use and GPT integrations, but still evolving toward a plugin-agnostic dispatcher.

🎯 STRATEGIC ROADMAP OPTIONS
Option A: GPT Identity & Role Integration System (Continue Now)
Pros:

Ensures all GPTs (e.g. @AgentX, @LindaGPT) get scoped roles & WP access

Makes the Universal Endpoint safer out-of-the-box

Lets each GPT assume a named user identity

Cons:

Still dependent on the Action Schema for true multi-agent orchestration

Option B: OpenAI Action Schema Integration (Start Now)
Pros:

Foundation for agent-driven automation (OpenAI/GPTs follow strict schemas)

Allows tooling like @ActionAgent to interop across WordPress, APIs, CRON

Cons:

Complex if GPTs don’t yet have identity & access mapping

🔄 RECOMMENDATION
✅ Proceed with GPT Identity & Role Integration System first.
This guarantees each agent is securely scoped, and we can enforce restrictions per action. Once that’s in place, we layer in the OpenAI Action Schema to formalize how agents call those actions.
