1. Self-Documenting Endpoints
Auto-Discovery: Each new action registered with the dispatcher can self-register its schema, description, approval level, and example, ensuring the admin UI and OpenAPI schema are always current.

Bonus: Offer a /webmastergpt/v1/actions endpoint returning all available actions/types, parameters, and docs—making it “future-proof” for new AIs.

2. Dynamic Capability Negotiation
Handshake API: When a new CustomGPT or AI connects, it can request the site’s full action/capability set and adapt its instructions accordingly.

Fallback: If a GPT tries an unsupported action, the endpoint can suggest the closest available action or return a schema update.

3. Action Approval Workflow
Admin Dashboard: Visual “Inbox” for pending, approved, rejected, and historical AI actions (with one-click approve/reject and notes).

Smart Notifications: Email or Slack notifications for high-risk actions, with approve/reject links.

Time-based rules: Auto-approve low-risk actions after X minutes or on non-production environments.

4. AI Audit Trail & Analytics
Comprehensive Log: Every AI/agent-initiated action is logged (who, when, what, outcome, before/after for file edits).

Reporting: Weekly/monthly summary of all automated actions, errors, and security events.

Anomaly Detection: Alerts on unusual activity patterns.

5. Role-based AI Permissions
API Key Tiers: Different keys (or agents) can be limited to specific actions/types (e.g., “ContentGPT” can only create posts, “WebMasterGPT” can edit plugins).

UI for key management: Admin can create, revoke, and assign scopes to API keys from the dashboard.

6. Plugin/Theme Extensibility
Hooks for Add-Ons: Allow third-party plugins or themes to register new “webmaster actions” for discovery and remote AI control.

Marketplace Vision: One day, a directory for “AI-ready actions” or “WebmasterGPT Skills” that can be added like add-ons.

7. User Training & Playbooks
Prompt Library: Built-in, evolving list of sample “commands” for CustomGPTs and users (copy-paste ready, discoverable in admin).

Step-by-Step Macros: Support for AI-powered, multi-step “playbooks” (e.g., “Clone and migrate a plugin, then activate and log result”).

8. Secure, AI-Driven Site Recovery
Rollback on Fail: For every file or database edit, create a rollback point. If an action triggers a critical error, the plugin can auto-restore or prompt the admin to do so.

Safe Mode: Emergency endpoint to disable all AI/autonomous actions except “undo”/“recovery”.

9. Remote, Multi-Site, and SaaS Mode
Central Control: Allow a single AI agent or dashboard to manage multiple sites from one interface, using secure tokens and endpoints.

SaaS Extension: Offer this as a service, where users can monitor and approve actions for many sites centrally.

10. Human-AI Co-Pilot UI
AI “Suggestions” Panel: The plugin suggests actions (e.g., “You haven’t updated plugins in 30 days. Update now?”), and the admin can approve with one click.

Conversational Log: Show the conversation/history between the GPT agent and the admin directly in the WP dashboard for transparency and debugging.

Bonus: Developer and AI Ecosystem
CLI for Developers: Command-line tools for power users to trigger actions, manage keys, and debug.

API Versioning: Built-in support for future schema and endpoint changes without breaking existing AI integrations.

AI Agent “Marketplace”: Framework for others to build and sell/share their CustomGPT or automation modules.
