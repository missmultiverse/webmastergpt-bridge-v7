B. Suggested/Future Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Purpose	Status
/create-post	POST	Create new WordPress post	To Implement
/get-article-count	GET	Return total # of articles (posts)	To Implement
/list-directories	GET	List all directories within specified path (e.g., plugins)	To Implement
/get-plugin-status	GET	Status of all installed plugins	(Covered by /webmaster-action with list_plugins in V6)

/reset-plugin-settings	POST	Reset plugin settings to default	To Implement

C. Notes and Best Practices
Security:
Most endpoints require a valid API key (x-api-key) in the header or as a POST parameter, and/or admin capability for critical actions (edit, approve, reset).

Approval Workflow:
Actions that can alter site state (deploying plugins, editing files) may be routed to pending actions and require explicit admin approval via /approve-action or /reject-action.

Extensibility:
All endpoints should be easily extensible for custom actions, new modules, and additional health or diagnostic routines.

Self-healing:
The plugin includes logic for autonomous repair, file rollback, and schema self-description (via /openapi-schema).

D. API Action Map
Already in V6 (core/merged/multi-action):

/webmaster-action covers:

List plugins (list_plugins)

List users (list_users)

List themes (list_themes)

Site stats (site_stats)

Edit htaccess (edit_htaccess)

(Add more as needed: e.g., list_directories, check_db_health, etc.)

Not yet in V6 (proposed for future):

/create-post, /clear-cache, /enable-debugging, /reset-plugin-settings, etc.

E. Implementation Roadmap
Complete Documentation:

Add endpoint summaries, parameters, and response examples to docs and OpenAPI schema.

Polish V6 Endpoints:

Ensure all /webmaster-action types are documented and tested.

Expand OpenAPI schema generator to include any new endpoints.

Admin UI Enhancements:

Add “Test” buttons and visual log of last action per endpoint in dashboard.

Inline documentation/tips for each action tab.

Future-Proofing:

Build stubs for proposed endpoints so CustomGPT or future agents can “discover” available actions.

Mark admin-only endpoints clearly in schema/docs.

Testing:

Test all endpoints with cURL, Postman, and GPT/agent commands.

Validate OpenAPI schema in GPT and external OpenAPI tools.

Security Review:

Revisit API key usage and privilege checks.

Add logging for all state-changing endpoints.

Release & Versioning:

Tag this as v6.0 stable when core is complete.

Maintain changelog for future reference and team onboarding.

How to Use This Doc
Use the table as a quick reference for all implemented and planned endpoints.

Keep the doc in the plugin repo (e.g., ENDPOINTS-ROADMAP.md or DEVELOPER-DOC.txt) for your team and future development.

Add version/date at the top for clarity.
